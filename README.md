# i-need-to-touch-grass
Project for UofTHacks 11.

This project, I Need To Touch Grass, allows users to quickly and easily find various natural areas near them, as well as pictures and directions. I Need To Touch Grass uses the Google Maps API for Python.

To interact with the user interface, open main_interaction.py.
The files admin.py, apps.py, models.py, tests.py, urls.py, and views.py are part of the Django interface I created for this program. However, I recommend using main_interaction.py at this time as it has more functionality.
